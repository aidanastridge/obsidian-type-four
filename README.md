### What is Ridge Racer Type Four?

Developed and published by Namco, Ridge Racer Type 4 was and is an arcade-style racing game released for the PlayStation in 1998 (Japan) and 1999 (North America and Europe). Praised for its slick presentation, music, and gameplay, R4 collasced into a swan-song for the console. 

### Thank Yous
