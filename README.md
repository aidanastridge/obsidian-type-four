### What is R4: Ridge Racer Type Four?

Developed and published by Namco, R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 was and is an arcade-style racing game released for the PlayStation in 1998 (Japan) and 1999 (North America and Europe). Praised for its slick presentation, music, and gameplay, R4 collasced into a swan-song for the console. 

### Thank Yous

First off, thank you to Namco for creating one of the best games ever made; Secondly, thank you Obsidan for an amazing note-taking platform with [extensive resources](https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme) and [community hubs](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+Theme+Designers) for creating themes – I'm learning to use CSS/SASS as I create this theme!

### Preface

R4: Ridge Racer Type Four's UI is beautiful, but it could become exuasting for how long someone might use Obsidian; Concessions had to be made so it was pleasing to the eye.
